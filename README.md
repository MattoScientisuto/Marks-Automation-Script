# Marks-Automation-Script
Python automation script to read proprietary data from Baselight and Flame machines. Can calculate file system frame and job locations, upload to MongoDB, and export as CSV or XLS including time-code and video thumbnail preview.

Final project for COMP 467 - Multimedia Systems Design at California State University Northridge during Spring 2023. Project overview and idea was managed by Professor Kevin Chaja. Everyone in the class was given complete creative freedom on how to create and organize this project, so it presented a great opportunity for independent research and learning about my own programming strengths and weaknesses.

Utilizes the following:
- argparse
- pymongo
- pandas
- openpyxl
- shlex
- subprocess
